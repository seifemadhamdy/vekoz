## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Architecture Overview

The application follows Clean Architecture principles with MVVM pattern, ensuring:

- Clear separation of concerns
- High testability
- Scalable and maintainable codebase
- Unidirectional data flow

### Key Technical Decisions

#### UI Layer

- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern declarative UI toolkit for native Android development
- **Material Design 3**: Latest material design guidelines for a polished user experience
- **Compose Navigation**: Type-safe navigation between screens
- **State Flow & Live Data**: Reactive state management
- **Coil**: Efficient image loading and caching

#### Domain Layer

- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between data, domain, and presentation layers
- **Use Cases**: Encapsulated business logic
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data sources
- **Coroutines**: Asynchronous programming
- **State Flow**: Reactive data streams

#### Data Layer

- **Retrofit**: Type-safe HTTP client for API communication
- **Room Database**: Local data persistence for watchlist
- **GSON**: JSON parsing
- **Repository Implementation**: Single source of truth pattern

#### Dependency Injection

- **Hilt**: Streamlined DI implementation
- **Modular Design**: Easy to test and maintain

## üîÑ Trade-offs & Decisions

1. **Offline-First vs Online-First**

   - Chose online-first approach due to the dynamic nature of movie data
   - Cached essential data for watchlist functionality

2. **Compose vs XML**

   - Selected Compose for modern UI development
   - Faster development and better maintainability
   - Slight learning curve for developers new to declarative UI

3. **State Management**
   - Used combination of StateFlow and LiveData
   - StateFlow for UI states
   - LiveData for lifecycle-aware observations

## üîú Future Improvements

1. **Technical**
   - Implement Kotlin Multiplatform
   - Add more unit and integration tests
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline
   - Performance optimization for large lists

## üß™ Testing

The project includes unit tests using:

- JUnit
- Mockito

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Change TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN to yours in `tmdb.properties`:
   ```
   TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN = "{YOUR_API_KEY}"
   ```
3. Build and run the project
